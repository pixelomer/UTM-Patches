# UTM Patches

Various patches for UTM

## History

Back when this tweak was created, UTM was really new and it had a lot of issues. This tweak attempted to fix some of them. Specifically, it made it possible to boot PowerPC VMs and it made mouse interaction work in Mac OS X. These issues are now fixed in UTM itself so this tweak is unnecessary.
